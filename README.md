Hello there!

This is my submission for the Google Homepage project for the Odin Project. If you are reading this, 
than you are currently checking out my submission, and I thank you for taking interest in my work!

Down below will be a step-by-step on what I did to complete this project, as well as my thought process
while writing some of thie code.


Step-by-step guide on what I did: 

1. I created my github repository and got my files created and committed. 
2. I started by creating a index.html, style.css, images, and readme file.
3. I took the google image provided from the project page in the Odin Project, 
saved it, and threw it into the images folder to use for my project. 
4. I created a large majority of the html. It didn't look pretty, and all of my links don't go 
anywhere, but I got all of my elements in there that I needed to replacate the google homepage.
5. I worked on my css for the website. This is always the hard part for me, since I'm not very good
with art and graphic design or anything similar to that, so this is where I needed to spend a lot of 
time "finagling", as I like to put it (basically just means messing around), with different css code
to try and get as close as I could to the actual google homepage design.
6. Everything was pretty much done, so all I needed to do was commit my changes and push it to the
master branch. Unfortuantely, and I have no idea why, but a fragment of my git tree got corrupted, so
I had to copy all of my work into a different file, clone a new version of my repository, throw all of
my work in there, and push all of that. So, unfortunately, there aren't any commits showing my work
between when I started and when I finish. Oh well!
7. Finish writing the readme page, and I was done!


I had a lot of fun making this project (even though it really wasn't so bad compared to what I will
have to do in the future), so thanks Odin Project!
